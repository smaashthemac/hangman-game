# Harry Potter Hangman Game

This game is classic hangman with a Harry Potter theme. You are given a random word with blanks instead of letters, and it's up to you to figure out the word, letter by letter, before your guesses run out. This was our first big foray into using Javascript to create something fun and functional.

This project was created as an assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin.
